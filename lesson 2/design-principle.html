                <h3>Contrast</h3>

                <p>
                    The contrast principle help give energy to the site and make the important elemets stand out. This principle can be
                    avieved by manupilating colors, pictures, fonts etc. This is perhaps one of the most important principles when it comes
                    to making a web site look nice and strong.

                <p>

                    them to understand the orrganization of it.

                <h3>Repetition</h3>

                <p>
                    Repetition means to use the same patters in you website in order to create a sense of  consistency,
                    and cohesiveness. It is important to be careful and try not to use a lof of the same elements and make your 
                    site look boring but keep the uniqueness of it.
