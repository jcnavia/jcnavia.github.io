                <h3>Contrast</h3>
                <p>Tesla</p>
                <p><a href = "https://www.tesla.com//">tesla.com</a></p>
                <img src = "images/tesla.jpg" alt = "tesla website" />
                <p>
                    The contrast principle help give energy to the site and make the important elemets stand out. This principle can be
                    avieved by manupilating colors, pictures, fonts etc. This is perhaps one of the most important principles when it comes
                    to making a web site look nice and strong.

                <h3>Proximity</h3>
                <p>The Apple Store</p>
                <p><a href = "https://www.apple.com/shop">https://www.apple.com/shop</a></p>
                <img src = "imgages/iphone.PNG" alt = "iphone11" />
                <p>
                    This prnciple refers to bringing the elements in your website closer of further to achieve a more organized look.
                    This principle will help ypur viewer have a better idea of the organizaition of your site and will provide less work 
                    them to understand the orrganization of it.

                <h3>Repetition</h3>
                <p>Brighan Youn University-Idaho</p>
                <p><a href = "https://www.byui.edu/">www.byui.com</a></p>
                <img src = "images" alt = "BYUI home page" />
                <p>
                    Repetition means to use the same patters in you website in order to create a sense of  consistency,
                    and cohesiveness. It is important to be careful and try not to use a lof of the same elements and make your 
                    site look boring but keep the uniqueness of it.
