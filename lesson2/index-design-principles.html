    <p class= "description1">
      The Alignment principle is about making your design look like every element is connected by an invisible line. It is about the unity among the elemts in a single look. All the elements should have a visual connection, this is possible to do with the use od grids. Pages that do not use the aligment principle tend to look less sophisticated and less professional.

      </div>
    <p class="description2"> 
        The principle of repetition means the re-use of similar elemts in your design. This will bring a sense of consistency to your page and cohesiveness. A pattern in the elemnts and their organization is visible.

    <h2 class="design3">Contrast</h2>
    <div class="contrast" >

    <p class= "description3">
      The principle of contrast reffers to the difference in the elements of your page. This is one of the most powerful designs when it comes to really wanting to emphisez the difference in the elemnts. It can be used by the different variation of colors, fonts and space.
